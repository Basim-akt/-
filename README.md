### Project Description
A fun AI-powered tool that predicts how bald you might be in the futureโusing your webcam. It scans your current hairline and shows a humorous simulation of your future selfโฆ follicle-free!
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Millions of people live in uncertainty, not knowing when the bald fairy might visit. This lack of โhair-time awarenessโ is a global crisis in the comedy department.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We bring peace of mind (or at least laughter) by letting you peek into your bald future, so you can start shopping for caps, wigs, or sunscreen early.
